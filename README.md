# Operation-Analytics-and-Investigating-Metric-Spike
While working in this project, I have engaged in Operational Analytics and delved into investigating metric spikes using advanced SQL techniques. As a Lead Data Analyst, I worked with diverse datasets, including job data and user events, to answer pivotal questions from various departments. I've analyzed job reviews, calculated throughput trends, examined language shares, detected duplicate rows, and tackled user engagement, growth, and retention analyses. My role also encompassed exploring email engagement patterns and presenting insightful interpretations of the query results.
